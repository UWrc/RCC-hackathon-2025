## ðŸš€ Getting Started with Docker for HPC Research

Unfortuantely, due to low staffing, this will be a self-guided workshop. 

This repository contains materials to help you get started with Docker, including some advanced topics like multi-platform builds. Whether you're new to containers or looking to sharpen your skills, this workshop is designed to give you practical, hands-on experience.

### ðŸ“š Workshop Materials:
All materials are available here: https://containers-at-tacc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

### Why Docker?
Docker is a powerful and user-friendly container tool that simplifies the process of building, sharing, and running applications in a portable and reproducible way. It has a vast public repository of container images ([**Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com/)), excellent community support, and robust features for customizing containers to fit your needs.

Although Docker is not available on Hyak HPC clustersâ€”because it requires root privileges to runâ€”we fully support container-based workflows. Instead, we use Apptainer (formerly Singularity), which allows users to run containers securely without elevated permissions.

Docker and Apptainer complement each other well: you can build custom containers with Docker on your local machine or in the cloud, then run them seamlessly on the cluster using Apptainer. This makes Docker a great tool for developing and testing your software before scaling up on HPC resources.
