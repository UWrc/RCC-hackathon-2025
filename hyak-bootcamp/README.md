## Hyak Bootcamp

**Instructor-led section - Kristen Finch - HPC Staff Scientist; UW-IT Research Computing** 

If you are a beginner with Hyak, I will be leading the fundamental Hyak on-boarding tutorials at this year's Hackathon. All the materials and videos are available on [**Hyak's documentation website**](https://hyak.uw.edu/docs) under the Tutorials section. 

1. Open OnDemand - I'll demonstrate a recent feature of Hyak that lowers the barrier to adopting Hyak for your research computing. Open OnDemand makes it easy to use certain applications that require a Graphical User Interface like Jupyter Notebooks, Rstudio, VSCode, MATLAB, and some with the virtual desktop application. 

2. [**Hyak Basics**](https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/hyak101/basics/syllabus) - a tutorial for brand new Hyak users demonstrating fundamental skills they will need to navigate the Hyak file system and Linux command-line interface (CLI).

3. [**Containers**](https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/hyak101/containers/syllabus) - demystifies containers and containerization of software for usage on Hyak. 

4. [**Slurm**](https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/hyak101/basics/syllabus_slurm) - this tutorial demystifies job submission and to help researchers efficiently use Hyak's computing resources.

5. [**Using GPUs on Hyak**](https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/gpus/gpu_start) - we'll talk about requesting GPU jobs on Hyak and work through building a custom container. I'll share Hyak GPU best practices and considerations. 

6. [**Advanced Slurm**](https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/hyak101/basics/syllabus_advanced) - IF TIME ALLOWS - this tutorial provides a worked example demonstrating the use of scripting with the Job Scheduler, Slurm, to execute a program from a software container.

Almost all of the above are available as video tutorials. [**Check out our Research Computing Training Playlist on UW-IT's YouTube channel.**](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-uLiqrTav1omqc7omKsLzRg2ng3nKCtj&si=ACwxjc0PV67AQfxm)
